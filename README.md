# Blogging

Minimal blog extension that makes use of TYPO3s core concepts and elements.

## Grab from TER

Not yet available.

## I want...

Certain things you might want that aren't included by default because I don't consider them to be a substaintial part of a "minimal" blog extension.

### Comments

Use Disqus or something similiar.

### Posts in the List plugin should have the full page content

You can do this easily by using VHS: ``<v:content.render pageUid="{post.uid}" />``.
